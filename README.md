## Configuring TAO

Download and copy the 2 files included in this repo:

```
views/templates/client_config.tpl
views/build/config/requirejs.build.json
```

over the existing files in your TAO instance.

This will set up your requirejs paths to work with the `tao-core-frontend` npm package if you installed it into `tao/views`.
